- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabrice. I'm working as a Sales Controller in a FMCG company. I'm also a Data Analyst (graduated from Datascientest data analyst program in March 2024).
I once created a website with Dreamweaver back in the days 👨‍🦳. But my journey in programming and data analytics truly started when I gave a try to Chat GPT.
I then realized that my job would dramatically change and that I needed to adapt. And there I am on Github!

- 🌱 Thanks to my Data Analytics degree I have a good knowledge of Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn and programming fundamentals with Python. But I know there's still a lot to learn.
I think that learning by doing is the best so I'll share some repo showing what I can do. Hopefully it will be entertaining and I'll get some feedback in the process so that I can further improve.

- ⚡ I'm fond of indie music. I'm a guitar geek and an amateur photgrapher 📸. I'm also interested in Science, Environmental issues, Arts and Economics. So I guess my projects will gravitate around these topics
